# Getting Started

Skema is a language to describe types, it can be used to generate other languages like typescript, jsonschema, graphql or describe your app domain model.


# Install the Cli
You need python 3.6+ 
```
pip3 install skema
```

# Usage

## Write some schema down
You can read more about the skema syntax in the docs
```yml
# schema.skema
Object:
    prop1: Str
    prop2: Float
    x: Int
    nested:
        name: Str
```

## Generate the code types
On the terminal execute 
```sh
cat schema.skema | skema to typescript > types.ts
cat schema.skema | skema to python > types.py
```
To generate the types for your language
We are using the stdin to pass the skema file and redirecting output to a file
